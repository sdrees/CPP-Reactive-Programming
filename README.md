This is the code repository for [C++ Reactive Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/c-reactive-programming?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788629775), published by Packt.

**Learn how to implement the reactive programming paradigm with C++ and build asynchronous and concurrent applications**

## What is this book about?
Reactive programming is an effective way to build highly responsive applications with an easy-to-maintain code base. This book covers the essential functional reactive concepts that will help you build highly concurrent, event-driven, and asynchronous applications in a simpler and less error-prone way.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand language-level concurrency in C++ 
* Explore advanced C++ programming for the FRP 
* Uncover the RxCpp library and its programming model 
* Mix the FP and OOP constructs in C++ 17 to write well-structured programs 
* Master reactive microservices in C++

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
/* close connection to server */
XCloseDisplay(display);

return 0;
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you’re a C++ developer interested in using reactive programming to build asynchronous and concurrent applications, you’ll find this book extremely useful. This book doesn’t assume any previous knowledge of reactive programming.

## Get to Know the Authors
**Praseed Pai**
has been working in the software industry for the last 25 years, starting his career as a MS-DOS systems programmer using ANSI C. He has been actively involved in developing large-scale, cross-platform, native code-based systems using C++ on Windows, GNU Linux, and macOS X. He has experience in COM+ and CORBA programming using C++. In the last decade, he has worked with Java- and .NET-based systems.

He is the primary implementer of the SLANG4.net compilation system, which has been ported to C++ with an LLVM backend. He coauthored .NET Design Patterns, by Packt Publishing.

**Peter Abraham**
has been a performance fanatic and a C/C++ programming language enthusiast right from his college days, where he excelled in Microsoft Windows programming and GNU Linux programming. He garnered experience in working with CUDA, image processing, and computer graphics programs by virtue of working with companies such as Quest Global, Siemens, and Tektronix.

Peter has been eagerly following the C++ standard and RxCpp libraries as part of his profession. He has worked with cross-platform GUI toolkits such as Qt, WxWidgets, and FOX toolkit.
